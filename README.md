# ajlarivi.github.io
* A dashboard visualization of the [Global Power Plant Database](https://datasets.wri.org/dataset/globalpowerplantdatabase) created for SENG480D at the University of Victoria.
* cursuory data processing was performed in jupyter lab, using pandas.
* Visualization can be viewied [here](https://ajlarivi.github.io/)

## Interaction
* Great lengths have been taken to make this dashboard as interactive and explortatory as possible. Most visualizations can be panned and zoomed,
and clicking countries or plants will highlight/zoom to the coresponding data on other visualiztions currently on screen.

## Some notes
* Many data entries for power plants did not have their commissioning year recorded, as such the temporal dataset is quite incomplete and should not be used
to interpret overall trends. View the United States for best results.
* Project scope only required the visualization work on one machine so CSS was not made to be dynamic. For best results view on a desktop computer with a wide monitor.
